# Waveshare Bionic Dog-Like Robot
Open Source for ESP32 And PI5/PI4B.

![](./README_footage/main.jpg)

## Basic Description
The WAVEGO is a 12-DOF bionic dog-like robot which features 2.3kg.cm large torque bus servos with feedback, reliable structure, and flexible motion, incorporating devices like front camera, 9-axes motion tracker, RGB indicator, etc., together with open source multi-platform Web application. It uses the ESP32 as sub controller for connecting rod inverse solving and gait generation, sharing calculating task for the host controller, an additional Raspberry Pi can be attached as the host controller for high-level decision operating.

The upper computer communicates with the lower computer (the robot's driver based on ESP32) by sending JSON commands via GPIO UART. The host controller, which employs a Raspberry Pi, handles AI vision and strategy planning, while the sub-controller, utilizing an ESP32, manages motion control and sensor data processing. This setup ensures efficient collaboration and enhanced performance.

## Features
- Real-time video based on WebRTC
- Cross-platform web application base on Flask
- Auto targeting (OpenCV)
- Object Recognition (OpenCV)
- Gesture Recognition (MediaPipe)
- Face detection (OpenCV & MediaPipe)
- Motion detection (OpenCV)
- Color Recognition (OpenCV)
- Multi-threaded CV processing
- Shortcut key control
- Photo taking
- Video Recording

## Quick Install
You can use this tutorial to install this program on a pure Raspberry Pi OS.  


### Download the repo from github

You can clone this repository from Waveshare's GitHub to your local machine.

    git clone https://github.com/waveshareteam/WAVEGO_Pro.git
    
### Grant execution permission to the installation script
    cd WAVEGO_Pro/ugv_rpi/
    sudo chmod +x setup.sh
    sudo chmod +x autorun.sh
### Install app (it'll take a while before finish)
    sudo ./setup.sh
### Autorun setup
    ./autorun.sh
### AccessPopup installation
    cd AccessPopup
    sudo chmod +x installconfig.sh
    sudo ./installconfig.sh
    *Input 1: Install AccessPopup
    *Press any key to exit
    *Input 9: Exit installconfig.sh
### Reboot Device
    sudo reboot

After powering on the robot, the Raspberry Pi will automatically establish a hotspot, and the LED screen will display a series of system initialization messages:  

![](./media/RaspRover-LED-screen.png)
- The first line `E` displays the IP address of the Ethernet port, which allows remote access to the Raspberry Pi. If it shows No Ethernet, it indicates that the Raspberry Pi is not connected to an Ethernet cable.
- The second line `W` indicates the robot's wireless mode. In Access Point (AP) mode, the robot automatically sets up a hotspot with the default IP address `192.168.50.5`. In Station (STA) mode, the Raspberry Pi connects to a known WiFi network and displays the IP address for remote access.
- The third line `F/J` specifies the Ethernet port numbers. Port `5000` provides access to the robot control Web UI, while port `8888` grants access to the JupyterLab interface.
- The fourth line `STA` indicates that the WiFi is in Station (STA) mode. The time value represents the duration of robot usage. The dBm value indicates the signal strength RSSI in STA mode.  


You can access the robot web app using a mobile phone or PC. Simply open your browser and enter `[IP]:5000` (for example, `192.168.10.50:5000`) in the URL bar to control the robot.  

If the robot is not connected to a known WiFi network, it will automatically set up a hotspot named "`AccessPopup`" with the password `1234567890`. You can then use a mobile phone or PC to connect to this hotspot. Once connected, open your browser and enter `192.168.50.5:5000` in the URL bar to control the robot.  


### Reboot Device
If the program fails to run and encounters errors related to v4l2.py during runtime, you need to delete v4l2.py from both the Python virtual environment and the user environment. This will allow the program to automatically use the system-wide v4l2.py.  

    cd WAVEGO_Pro/ugv_rpi/  
    sudo rm ugv-env/lib/python3.11/site-packages/v4l2.py  
    sudo rm /home/[your_user_name]/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/v4l2.py  

Now you can restart the main program app.py.
